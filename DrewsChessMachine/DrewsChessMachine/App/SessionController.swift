/// Owns long-lived session networks, lifted out of `UpperContentView` as the
/// first slice (Stage 4a) of the session-lifecycle decomposition.
///
/// **Scope of this slice.** `SessionController` holds the three life-of-app
/// inference networks the arena and the candidate-test probe run against
/// (`candidateInferenceNetwork` / `arenaChampionNetwork` / `probeInferenceNetwork`,
/// plus the probe's `ChessRunner`), and the `performBuild()` static used by the
/// build paths. These are the network pieces that have no entanglement with the
/// rest of `UpperContentView`'s `@State` — they're lazily built on the first
/// Play-and-Train start and never torn down, and the view only reads them or
/// nil-coalesces a lazy build.
///
/// **Deliberately still on the view (for now).** The champion `network` + its
/// `runner`, `networkStatus`, `isBuilding`, and the `buildNetwork()` /
/// `ensureChampionBuilt()` flow stay on `UpperContentView` this slice: the
/// champion-network property is named `network` and referenced ~150 places, and
/// moving it cleanly wants a property rename first so a mechanical `network` →
/// `session.network` rewrite can't collide with `network:` argument labels.
/// That, plus the trainer / arena / parallel-stats buckets and the two giant
/// orchestration methods (`startRealTraining`, `runArenaParallel`), land in
/// follow-up Stage 4 slices. At that point the popover / auto-resume /
/// checkpoint controllers can take `weak var session` to drop their own
/// view-capturing closures.
