/// Under those preconditions there is exactly one writer (the source's

/// - `LiveTrainerMoveEvaluationSource` overlays the live trainer's

///   can be played against the in-progress trainee.
///
/// Self-play and arena no longer use this abstraction — they run

/// Caller-owned destination contract: every `evaluate` call writes
/// exactly `ChessNetwork.policySize` floats into `intoPolicy` (provided

/// ∈ [−1, +1]` (the W/D/L head's softmax · `[+1, 0, −1]`). The
/// destination buffer:
///
/// - must have `count == ChessNetwork.policySize` (preconditioned),
/// - must alias memory the caller keeps alive until this `await` returns,
/// - must not be aliased by any other concurrent `evaluate` call.
///
/// Players (the canonical caller, `MPSChessPlayer`) pre-allocate a

/// every ply; one ply runs at a time per player, so no aliasing is
/// possible. This replaces the previous `[Float]`-returning contract,
